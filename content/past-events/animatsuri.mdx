On 6 October 2024, the artists' association
**<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sun.shine.house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunshine House</a>**
conducted the second edition of **_Animatsuri_**, a showcase of independent artists from Chennai. One of India's largest fan-art exhibitions, it included 80+ creators. There were cosplay performances, quizzes, karaoke events, merchandise booths, a manga library and food stalls, with a primary focus on Japanese and other east Asian culture, such as anime/manga fan-art, video game merch and gaming arcades (in collaboration with the **Versus Festival**). We are proud to announce that two artists from Bengaluru Anime Club - _Ita-Torakking_ and _Dhitika_ - exhibited their works at *Animatsuri*.
