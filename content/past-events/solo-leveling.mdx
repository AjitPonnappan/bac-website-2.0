Bengaluru Anime Club (BAC) hosted a fan screening of *Solo Leveling: ReAwakening* on December 8th at Vaishnavi Sapphire Mall, Yeshwantpura, in collaboration with AniSync and PVR Cinemas. About 50 hunters turned up and were treated to commemorative posters and cards courtesy of Sony Pictures and AniSync, as well as special tickets drawn by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sep_poppo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sep</a> and sponsored by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zolivesofficial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zolives</a>. There were _leveling up_ opportunities as well, involving maze solving and other fun activities!

AniSync also sponsored giveaways, in which the winners got AniSync Coupons to redeem *BAC merch* - T-shirts which are set to release at <a href="https://japanhabba.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japan Habba 2025</a>.
