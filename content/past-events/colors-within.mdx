Naoko Yamada's latest work **_The Colours Within_** was eagerly anticipated by anime lovers, and so Bengaluru Anime Club, in collaboration with [AniSync](https://store.anisync.com/), hosted a fan screening on November 24th at [PVR](https://www.pvrcinemas.com/) Orion Mall. Attendees — who numbered a record 68 — were treated to character cards (drawn by BAC member <a href="https://linktr.ee/ilafeline98" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ila</a>), commemorative tickets (designed by Steve) and bookmarks (designed by Saurev) courtesy of AniSync. Futtaim (Fak) conducted a quiz on *The Colours Within* and Naoko Yamada, with questions prepared by him and Sakaido.

In the week leading up to the screening, BAC members wrote a series of articles on Naoko Yamada's previous works — from the beautiful animations of [K-On!](/blog/naoko-yamada-k-on) to the struggles of growing up in [Tamako Love Story](/blog/tamako_love_story), from the raw emotions of [A Silent Voice](/blog/silent_voice), to subtle, bittersweet [Liz and the Blue Bird](/blog/liz_and_blue_bird), and the sheer ephemerality of [The Heike Story](/blog/heike_story).

This screening would not have been possible without **AniSync**, **PVR Cinemas**, **Warner Brothers**, **our team of volunteers (Kushal, Gaurav, Saurev, Nabz)** and **every single fan** who turned up! Stay tuned for more anime screenings and other events in the near future!
