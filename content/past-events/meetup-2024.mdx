BAC hosted an engaging and fun-filled meet-up on a crisp winter afternoon on November 30th, 2024, at Cubbon Park.
Our admins, **medha/ᐠ.ꞈ.ᐟ\\** and **Futtaim**, led the event as speakers.
The meet-up began with introductions, where attendees shared their origins, favorite anime, and stories of how they got into animanga.

One of the highlights was a group battle of Jankenpon (Japanese for rock-paper-scissors), which brought a competitive side and plenty of laughter from the group.
This was followed by heated yet friendly debates on animanga "hot takes".

As the meet-up concluded, hunger kicked in, and the group decided to take a walk to Church Street.
The bustling lane provided the perfect backdrop for a cozy meal at Empire Restaurant.
The weather was a blessing — chilly enough to evoke winter vibes without the inconvenience of rain.
Bengaluru was truly at its best, making the entire event even more enjoyable.
